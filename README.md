# personal-website

A template for an academic personal website, configurable by updating two files only, and built without any dependency in vanilla JavaScript.

Make it yours by updating the `resume.js` file at the root of the directory, and the `publications.json` and `author_stats.json` files in the `publications` directory.

The `publications.json` file can be automatically generated using *e.g.* Zotero. 

Some things to consider:

- Publications **must have** either a DOI, an URL, or an ISSN.
- Projects **must have** a start date and an end date (they are sorted using the end date).
- Education and work experience **must have** a start date (they are sorted using the start date).
