    about: "Researcher in plant modelling, manager of the FSPM research theme @UmrAmap.",
    summary: {
      first: `I'm a researcher at the AMAP lab in CIRAD, specializing in plant modeling. I focus on agronomy and develop models that help us understand how plants grow and produce based on their environment and how they're managed.`,
      second: `My research primarily deals with perennial crops like oil palm üå¥, cacao üç´, and coffee ‚òï. I also explore mixed cropping systems üå±üåΩ and agroforestry ü´ëüå≥ü•¨, aiming to improve sustainable farming practices. I use innovative methods like whole-plant flux chambers and lidar to measure and study plants.`,
      third: `By creating and testing these models, I develop new ideas about plant functions and find better ways to manage crops. I also create my own software to support this work, ensuring that my models are as accurate and useful as possible.`,
