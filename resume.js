    about:
      "Researcher in plant modelling, with a special interest in real-world applications.",
    summary:
      `I am a researcher at the AMAP lab in CIRAD specializing in plant modeling. 
      My work involves creating functional-structural plant models that can predict plant growth and yield based on environmental conditions and management practices. 
      My main goal is to develop scalable models that can be applied to different systems, from organs to plants, and even to complex systems like agroforestry. 
      Using my skills in agronomy, plant physiology, programming, and modeling, I aim to find sustainable solutions for farmers and stakeholders. 
      My work encompasses everything from innovative field measurement methods (such as whole-plant flux chambers and lidar) to developing hypotheses about plant functioning, implementing them into models, evaluating the models in isolation or in combination, and exploring innovative management approaches through prediction. 
      I also develop my own software to assist me in my modeling work.`,
