    about: `Researcher in plant modelling <a href="https://amap.cirad.fr/en/index.php" class="underline hover:text-accent-foreground" >@UmrAmap</a>.`,
    summary: {
      first: `I specialize in plant growth modeling, predicting plant development and yield based on genotype, environment, and management (<strong>GÃ—EÃ—M</strong>). My work bridges <strong>ecophysiology, agronomy, and computational modeling</strong> to better understand plant function and architecture.`,
      second: `A key focus of my research is <strong>digital twins</strong> â€”virtual models that replicate real plant systems to test hypotheses, predict responses, and optimize management strategies. By integrating high-resolution data acquisition (<em>lidar, gas exchanges</em>...) with <a class="underline hover:text-accent-foreground" href="https://virtualplantlab.github.io/PlantSimEngine.jl/stable/">cutting-edge modeling frameworks</a>, I aim to make simulations both realistic and actionable.`,
      third: `Driven by a passion for sustainability and technology, I develop tools that enhance resource efficiency, improve yield, and strengthen resilience, ensuring that research translates into tangible benefits for growers and stakeholders.`,
